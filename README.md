# algorithms_and_data_structures
This repo includes many different projects from the course "Algorithms and Data Structures" at the Technical University of Berlin. The object-oriented programming was done with Java. This repo includes many essential algorithms like Prim, Kruskal, Dijkstra, BFS, DFS, dynamic programming, backtracking and more. Also, I learned about a lot of new advanced data structures like hash tables, Index Priority Queues and graphs, just to name a few.
